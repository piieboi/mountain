## 3. Purpose of Data Collection

### 3a. Marketing Purposes:
Funding a project that has involved nearly three years of free labor is challenging. Therefore, we may collaborate with sponsors to help cover Project Mountain's production costs.

## 4. Data Security

All data we collect will be securely stored on our own drives. We take the necessary precautions to keep your data safe.

## 5. Transaction Information

We do not process any payments or transactions on our site or systems unless the price is $0.00 (free). In such cases, no payment processor is needed.

## 6. Termination

All data can be removed if your account is in good standing with Luaily LLC. After initiating the termination process, you have 30 days to request to download your data, after which the data will be removed from all our systems. To terminate your account, contact: krystallyne+mtnterm@pieboi.xyz.
